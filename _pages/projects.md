Currently, I am part of the [ARA Lab](https://ara.cse.unr.edu/), where my research is centered on motion planning and robust control for the Cube-drones and UAVs. 

Cube-drone
------
This research introduces a novel design for a bicycle-like robot, termed the Cube-drone. The design concept enables the robot to exhibit flexible mobility across diverse terrains, including flying, ground movement, and water navigation. This innovative robot type is designed to adapt to complex surfaces and structures, enhancing its inspection capabilities.

Unmanned aerial vehicle
------
This research focuses on designing a novel robust controller capable of adapting to white noise from external environments. The hierarchical sliding mode control structure facilitates further investigation into adaptive control strategies.

Undergraduate projects
------
Since 2021, I've been a member of the MEG team at HUST under the guidance of Assoc. Prof. Nguyen Tung Lam. Additionally, I've collaborated on several projects with Assoc. Prof. Dao Phuong Nam focuses on motion planning and optimal control for various nonlinear systems.

Overhead crane
-------
This research focuses on motion planning for overhead cranes and tower cranes, ensuring anti-swing behavior and identifying optimal solutions in static indoor environments. Additionally, this approach can adapt to external disturbances and system uncertainties through the use of an extended state observer.

Min-max MPC
-------
This research designs a novel type of model predictive control: a Min-Max MPC that ensures the stability of the system. Further investigation into recursive feasibility is also included.
