Hi guys, I'm Van Chung!
I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in [Computer Science](https://www.unr.edu/cse) at the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/), and my minor in Control & Robotics. I'm a part of the [Advanced Robotics and Automation (ARA) Laboratory](https://ara.cse.unr.edu/) under the supervision of [Professor Hung (Jim) La](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uG-wAt0AAAAJ&hl=en). Before my Ph.D., I received my B.S. in Control Engineering & Automation from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2023. My current research focuses on motion planning and control theory for autonomous aerial robots & bridge inspection robots. **Please do not hesitate to contact me for more potential research collaboration!**
